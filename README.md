# What it does

This tool utilizes Marvin and python command-line interfaces to:
1) Download a map from a galaxy of your choice,
2) Prepare a .txt file for input into kinemetry,
3) Write idl code to run kinemetry, and
4) Uses the output of kinemetry to extract the higher order moments and best fit disk for the galaxy.

# Who it is for
The purpose of this tool is to provide a more accessible way for users of IFS data to carry out a quick kinematic analysis.
